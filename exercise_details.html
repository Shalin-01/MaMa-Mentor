        <h3>Things to Keep in Mind:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid exercises that involve lying flat on your back after the first trimester (this can reduce blood flow to your uterus).</li>
            <li>Avoid high-impact exercises, contact sports, or activities with a risk of falling.</li>
            <li>Listen to your body; if you feel any discomfort, stop and consult your healthcare provider.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and don’t overexert yourself.</li>
        </ul>
